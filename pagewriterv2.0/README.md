# PageWriter v2.0 — Simple Flow

**Flow:** Write → Analyze → Edit (same page). Minimal controls — just get one page done, see highlights, and revise in place.

- **Write:** free-write toward a word goal (250–500). Progress bar shows completion.
- **Analyze:** page is highlighted for repetition, filler words, passive voice, and tonal noise; stats show words, TTR, avg sentence, and hit counts.
- **Edit:** same page becomes editable again; highlights update live as you revise.

Runs locally as a single `index.html`.
