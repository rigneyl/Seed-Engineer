# Story Architect — MVP

Interactive timeline builder for writers with draggable beats and export to Markdown.

## Features
- **Templates**: 3‑Act, 4‑Act, and 12‑Beat (select from the dropdown).
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder beats within a lane or move them between lanes.
- **Inline editing**: Edit beat titles and summaries directly on the cards.
- **Export**: One‑click export to Markdown (`.md`) or JSON (`.json`).
- **Import**: Load a previously exported JSON file.
- **Autosave**: Persists your work to the browser (localStorage).
- **Reset**: Start a fresh project at any time.

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

## Tips
- Use the **Project title** and **Logline** inputs at the top to personalize your export.
- Switching templates loads their default beats. Your prior work remains available in localStorage until you press **Reset** (you can also export JSON first).
